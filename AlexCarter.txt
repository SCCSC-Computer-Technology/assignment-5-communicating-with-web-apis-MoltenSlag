The GetStudentProfiles method retrieves all student profiles from the database asynchronously using Entity Framework's ToListAsync method. The GetStudentProfile method
retrieves a single student profile by ID from the database asynchronously using Entity Framework's FindAsync method. The PutStudentProfile method updates a student 
profile in the database. It sets the state of the provided studentProfile object to Modified, which tells Entity Framework to update the corresponding entity in the 
database. The PostStudentProfile method adds a new student profile to the database and returns a CreatedAtAction result with the newly created profile's ID.The 
DeleteStudentProfile method removes a student profile from the database asynchronously. Great job overall in my view.
